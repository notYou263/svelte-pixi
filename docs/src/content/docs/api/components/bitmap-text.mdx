import ComponentAPI from '$lib/components/ComponentAPI.astro'

Renders a line or multiple lines of text using bitmap font.

The primary advantage of this class over Text is that all of your textures are pre-generated and loading, meaning that rendering is fast, and changing text has no performance implications.

Supporting character sets other than latin, such as CJK languages, may be impractical due to the number of characters.

To split a line you can use '\n', '\r' or '\r\n' in your string.

PixiJS can auto-generate fonts on-the-fly using BitmapFont or use fnt files provided by: http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ for Windows or http://www.bmglyph.com/ for Mac.

You can also use SDF, MSDF and MTSDF BitmapFonts for vector-like scaling appearance provided by: https://github.com/soimy/msdf-bmfont-xml for SDF and MSDF fnt files or https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen for SDF, MSDF and MTSDF json files

A BitmapText can only be created when the font is loaded.

## Usage

```svelte live props={{ bg: 'white' }}
<script>
  import { Application, AssetsLoader, BitmapText } from 'svelte-pixi'
</script>

<AssetsLoader assets={['/assets/desyrel.xml']}>
  <BitmapText
    text={'the fox jumps over\nthe lazy dog'}
    x={380}
    y={200}
    anchor={0.5}
    style={{ fontName: 'Desyrel', fontSize: 48, align: 'center' }}
