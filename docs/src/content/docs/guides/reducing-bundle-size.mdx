title: Reducing Bundle Size
---

`pixi.js` is about [226kb minified + gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/pixi.js@7.3.2) (as of v7.3.2).
If you're only using a few features this may be a lot more than you need.

With a modern bundler it is possible to create your own pixi.js file with only the features you need. This
guide will show you how to do it using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as that is the most common bundler used with Svelte.

## Creating a custom pixi.js file

The `pixi.js` package is just a collection of various `@pixi/*` packages. If we look at their [package.json](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/blob/main/bundles/pixi.js/package.json),
we can see which ones we might want to install for ourselves.

I've picked out a few below. You can add/remove as necessary, but note that if any SveltePixi component
relies on the package you'll get an error. (For example, if you remove `@pixi/sprite` you'll get an error
when using `<Sprite />`.)

Copy & paste the following into a file called `pixi.js`:

```js
// custom pixi.js file
export * from '@pixi/accessibility'
export * from '@pixi/app'
export * from '@pixi/assets'
export * from '@pixi/basis'
export * from '@pixi/compressed-textures'
export * from '@pixi/core'
export * from '@pixi/display'
export * from '@pixi/events'
export * from '@pixi/extract'
export * from '@pixi/graphics'
export * from '@pixi/mesh'
export * from '@pixi/particle-container'
export * from '@pixi/prepare'
export * from '@pixi/sprite-animated'
export * from '@pixi/sprite-tiling'
export * from '@pixi/sprite'
export * from '@pixi/spritesheet'
export * from '@pixi/text-bitmap'
export * from '@pixi/text'
```

Make sure to install them too

```sh
npm install @pixi/accessibility @pixi/app @pixi/assets @pixi/basis @pixi/compressed-textures @pixi/core @pixi/display @pixi/events @pixi/extract @pixi/graphics @pixi/mesh @pixi/particle-container @pixi/prepare @pixi/sprite-animated @pixi/sprite-tiling @pixi/sprite @pixi/spritesheet @pixi/text-bitmap @pixi/text
```

## Aliasing

In order for SveltePixi to make use of this custom file we'll need to create an alias.

Update your `vite.config.js` file to include the following:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  /* ... */

  optimizeDeps: {
    // required so svelte-pixi will use pixi.js alias
    exclude: ['svelte-pixi'],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // update path to wherever your pixi.js is
      'pixi.js': '/src/pixi.js',
    },
  },
})
```
